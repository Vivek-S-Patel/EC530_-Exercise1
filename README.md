      In this repository I have created an API for a “Smart Home Software”.  This API can be used to organize and control the modules which are homes, 
users, rooms, and devices.  The module user includes a username which takes the form of a string and a house ID of the house they own which takes the 
form of an integer.  The module house includes a username of the owner which takes the form of a string and the number of rooms which takes the form of 
an integer.  The module rooms includes a username of the owner which takes the form of a string and the room name which takes the form of a string.  The 
module device includes the house ID of the house the device is in, the type of device it is, and the username of the owner of the house.In terms of error 
handling I have included error messages for when there are missing fields and modules are not found.
